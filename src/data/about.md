# Intro

My name is Siddhant Agarwal, and I am a third year Computer Science major and FinTech minor at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am from Mumbai, India, and I am currently living in Atlanta, GA.<br><br>

I am passionate about machine learning and building products that people like to use. I often explore the intersection of the two through
some of my personal projects and my classes at Georgia Tech.<br><br>

I recently developed the [Indian Premier League Simulator](https://x.com/S_Agarwal0402/status/1858448975013310686), an app that allows cricket fans to simulate both cricket player auctions and each ball of a cricket match. In its only week of launch, the app reached over 30,000 users and 250,000 views on twitter alone. I am looking to build this app further, and am looking for people to help me develop it!<br>

# Sports Analytics
I am very passionate about analyzing sports data, and I often post my analyses on twitter. I have gained over 20,000 impressions through these posts and have interacted with several analysts working with professional cricket teams. Some of my analyses are given below: <br><br>
- [Looking at "rest overs" between cricket bowlers' spells](https://x.com/S_Agarwal0402/status/1873722237611893064). This stat is not used in cricket analysis<br>
- [Scraping 1000+ cricket scorecards from ESPN](https://x.com/S_Agarwal0402/status/1745296483652440241) to improve data access in cricket<br>
- [Quantifying the quality of test match bowling spells this century](https://x.com/S_Agarwal0402/status/1741022124251468121)<br>
- [Introducing a statistic called the Non-boundary Strike Rate](https://x.com/S_Agarwal0402/status/1717408343294190059), which isn't used in typical cricket discourse
